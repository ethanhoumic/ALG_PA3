# PA3 of 2025 Spring Algorithm: Cycle Breaking
## Introduction

This is a programming assignment obtaining the total weight of removed edges to make the input graph acyclic.

## Usage
1. Clone the repo. 
2. Run the following command in terminal:
```
make
./bin/cb inputs/[input file name].in outputs/[output file name].out 
```

The program will display the CPU time and memory usage of the process.

## Sample I/O
Sample input:
```
u 
8
9
0 1 3
0 2 5
1 3 10
1 4 8
2 5 9
3 4 5
3 5 11
3 6 12
4 7 6
0
```

First character `u` means that the graph is undirected(`d` stands for directed), the first number `8` is the total number of vertices, and the second number `9` is the number of edges. The following are the starting vertex, ending vertex, and the weight of each edge. 

Sample output:
```
8
0 1 3
3 4 5
```

The first number `8` is the weight removed, and the following are the removed edges
